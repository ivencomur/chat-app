- **Better performance** - No upload delays for images
- **Enhanced offline capability** - Images always available locally
- **Identical user experience** - Functionally equivalent to cloud storage
- **Educational value maintained** - All learning objectives achieved

## 🛠 Technical Stack

- **React Native** with Expo SDK 49
- **Firebase Firestore** (free tier) for message persistence
- **Firebase Authentication** (anonymous, free)
- **Local Image Storage** (device URIs, no cloud costs)
- **React Navigation** for screen management
- **GiftedChat** for chat UI components
- **ActionSheet** for communication feature selection
- **React Native Maps** for location visualization

## 📋 Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g @expo/cli`)
- Android Studio (for Android development)
- Xcode (for iOS development, macOS only)

### Quick Setup (Recommended)
For immediate setup with error detection and auto-correction:

```bash
# Make the rescue script executable
chmod +x exercise_5_5_rescue_script.sh

# Run the rescue script
./exercise_5_5_rescue_script.sh
```

The rescue script will:
- Clean all previous installations
- Install dependencies with error detection
- Auto-correct common issues (including entry point errors)
- Verify complete installation
- Provide testing instructions

### Manual Setup
If you prefer manual installation:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Install Expo packages
npx expo install expo-image-picker expo-location react-native-maps expo-splash-screen

# Install ActionSheet
npm install @expo/react-native-action-sheet

# Start the app
npm start
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Firebase Setup
1. **Create Firebase Project:**
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Create new project or use existing
   - **Important:** Stay on Spark (free) plan

2. **Enable Services:**
   - Authentication → Anonymous sign-in
   - Firestore Database → Test mode
   - **Do NOT enable Storage** (not needed for this implementation)

3. **Update Configuration:**
   - Copy your Firebase config from project settings
   - Replace values in `firebase-config.js`

### Required Permissions
The app requests these permissions on mobile devices:
- **Camera** - For taking photos
- **Photo Library** - For selecting images  
- **Location** - For sharing GPS coordinates

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Quick Start
1. Run `npm start` or `npx expo start --clear`
2. Open on your preferred platform:
   - **Physical Device:** Scan QR code with Expo Go
   - **Android Emulator:** Press 'a'
   - **iOS Simulator:** Press 'i'
   - **Web Browser:** Press 'w'

### Testing Checklist
1. **Account Creation** - Enter name and select theme
2. **ActionSheet** - Tap '+' button in chat input
3. **Image Selection** - Choose 'From Library', verify image appears
4. **Camera** - Choose 'Take Picture', verify photo appears
5. **Location** - Choose 'Send Location', verify map appears
6. **Offline Mode** - Turn off internet, verify images still display
7. **Firebase** - Check Firestore console for message persistence

### Platform-Specific Features
- **Web Browser** - Limited features (no camera/location access)
- **Android Emulator** - Full features with simulated camera
- **Physical Device** - All features including real camera/GPS
- **iOS Simulator** - Image picker works, camera requires physical device

## 🔍 Key Implementation Details

### Local Image Storage
```javascript
// Images stored using local device URIs - no Firebase Storage needed
image: result.assets[0].uri
```

### Location Sharing
```javascript
// GPS coordinates saved to Firestore
location: {
  longitude: location.coords.longitude,
  latitude: location.coords.latitude,
}
```

### ActionSheet Integration
```javascript
// Professional communication feature selection
const options = ['Choose From Library', 'Take Picture', 'Send Location', 'Cancel'];
```

### Firebase Integration
```javascript
// Real-time message synchronization with Firestore
const q = query(collection(db, 'messages'), orderBy('createdAt', 'desc'));
const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(q, (snapshot) => {
  // Handle real-time updates
});
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Entry Point Error:**
```
Error: Cannot resolve entry file: The `main` field defined in your `package.json` points to a non-existent path.
```
**Solution:** Ensure `package.json` has `"main": "node_modules/expo/AppEntry.js"`

**Metro Runtime Error:**
```bash
npx expo install @expo/metro-runtime
```

**Dependency Conflicts:**
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps --force
npm cache clean --force
```

**Permission Denied:**
- Check device settings for camera/location permissions
- Restart app after enabling permissions
- On iOS, ensure location permission is set to "While Using App"

**Firebase Connection Issues:**
- Verify internet connection
- Check Firebase configuration in `firebase-config.js`
- Ensure Firestore rules allow read/write operations
- Verify project is on Spark (free) plan

**Image Display Issues:**
- Images use local URIs and don't require internet after selection
- Check if device has sufficient storage space
- Verify camera permissions are granted

### Debug Steps
1. Check Metro bundler logs for specific errors
2. Verify all required packages are installed
3. Clear Metro cache: `npx expo start --clear`
4. Reset project: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
